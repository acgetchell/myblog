[Causal Dynamical Triangulations] computes the path integral of the
quantum universe numerically.[^1]

$$I_{EH}=\int\mathcal{D}[g(M)]e^{iS_{EH}} \rightarrow  \sum \frac{1}{C_t}e^{-S_{R}}$$

Where $S_{EH}$ is the Einstein-Hilbert action:

$$S_{EH}=\int \left[\frac{1}{2\kappa}(R-2\Lambda)+\mathcal{L}_{M}\right]\sqrt{-g}d^4x$$

 And $S_{R}$ is the Regge action:

 $$S_{R}=\frac{1}{8\pi G}
 \left[\sum_{hinges}A_i\delta_i+\Lambda\sum_{simplices}V_i\right]$$

> What is a path integral and why would I want to compute it?

Good question! A reasonable answer will take us a bit far afield, and is the
subject of another (_pending_) post. For the sake of argument, let's proceed on
the assumption that it's something we want to compute.

To do this we use the [Metropolis-Hastings] algorithm, which is a
member of a more general class of algorithms known as
[Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)][3] methods, in particular random walk
Monte Carlo methods.

> Is this another long digression?

Probably.

Anyways, to have good results, we need to calculate something, in this case
perturbations of that universe via [ergodic moves], performed millions of
times per simulation accurately.[^2]

The simulated universe in general is an n-dimensional
[Delaunay Triangulation][5], which is a good[^5] discretized n-dimensional
manifold, which allows us to do [Regge calculus], or
["General Relativity without Coordinates"][6], conducted on said
triangulations.

Here is what these ergodic moves look like in 3D. By choosing to make these
moves according to the [Metropolis-Hastings] algorithm, we effectively sample
all possible paths as the universe moves from one time step to the next.

> Which is what the path integral is?

Exactly.

So, these are the moves which sample all possible (2+1) dimensional
discretized universes.

![(2,6) move](/img/26move.png)
![(4,4) move](/img/44move.png)

> So how do we use these moves?

First, let's start by generating a random, foliated triangulation with $n$
simplices and $t$ timeslices. [Here is a program to do that][12].

A foliated triangulation is a Delaunay triangulation with two criteria:

1. Each vertex has a time value
2. Each simplex contains vertices that differ by at most one time value

In (2+1) dimensions, then, we are dealing with simplices that have 4 vertices
(_an n-dimensional simplex always has n+1 vertices_).

We can thus classify the
(2+1) dimensional simplex as a (3,1) simplex (_3 vertices on the low timeslice
and one vertex on the high timeslice_), a (2,2) simplex, or a (1,3) simplex.

Likewise, we can name the moves similarly.

The top move takes a (3,1) simplex and a (2,2) simplex and converts it to a
(3,1) simplex plus two (2,2) simplices. This is called a (2,3) move, and it's
reverse is naturally a (3,2) move.

The middle move takes a (1,3) simplex and a (3,1) simplex and converts it to
three (1,3) simplices plus three (3,1) simplices. This is a (2,6) move along
with the reverse (6,2) move.

The bottom move takes two (1,3) simplices and two (3,1) simplices and makes
different (1,3) and (3,1) simplices. This is called a (4,4) move, and it is
it's own reverse.

The CDT action is then based on the Regge action:

$$S^{(3)} = 2\pi k\sqrt{\alpha}N_1^{TL} + N_3^{(3,1)}\left[-3k\text{arcsinh}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}\sqrt{4\alpha+1}}\right)-3k\sqrt{\alpha}\text{arccos}\left(\frac{2\alpha+1}{4\alpha+1}\right)-\frac{\lambda}{12}\sqrt{3\alpha+1}\right] + N_3^{(2,2)}\left[2k\text{arcsinh}\left(\frac{2\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2\alpha+1}}{4\alpha+1}\right)-4k\sqrt{\alpha}\text{arccos}\left(\frac{-1}{4\alpha+1}\right)-\frac{\lambda}{12}\sqrt{4\alpha+2}\right] $$

This formula is the Regge action with some trigonometric identities applied
after taking the length of spacelike edges to be 1 and the length of timelike
edges to be $\alpha$. There are a few more constants thrown in for good
measure.[^3]

However complex this looks, it generates a number.

Metropolis-Hastings then calculates the probability of making a move as:

$$ P=a_{1}a_{2}$$

Where:

$$ a_{1}=\frac{\text{move}[i]}{\sum_i\text{move}[i]} $$

And:

$$ a_{2}=e^{\Delta S} $$

$a_{1}$ is essentially the probability of making $\text{move}[i]$ versus
making all other moves, and $a_{2}$ is the change in the action caused by
making $\text{move}[i]$.

This comes from the fact that we are using Markov chains, which forget all
history except the previous move,[^6] and the principle of detailed balance,
which states that the probability of transitioning from $x\rightarrow x\prime$
equals the probability of $x\prime\rightarrow x$.

$a_{1}$ is easy to calculate: you just keep track of the total successful
moves of each type.

$a_{2}$ is likewise simple:

* A (2,3) move will change
$N_1^{TL}$ and $N_3^{(2,2)}$ by +1 each; a (3,2) by -1 each.

* A (2,6) move changes $N_3^{(3,1)}$ by +4 and $N_1^{TL}$ by +2; a (6,2)
by -4 and -2 respectively.

* A (4,4) move doesn't change the action at all; $a_2 = 1$, and only $a_1$ is
needed.

By attempting a large number of moves, some of which will be accepted[^7] and
some of which will be rejected, we can approximate the distribution thus
producing an [ensemble].

> Now what?

Now we can collect data on the various ensembles, and obtain things like
[spectral dimension][11], [transition amplitudes][10], or in my case, the
[Newtonian Limit][7].

So that's the backstory (_modulo some digressions_).

To have results before, well, the end of the universe, we should use a fast
language, e.g. C++ together with a battle-tested library capable of manipulating
Delaunay triangulations in various dimensions, e.g. [CGAL].[^4]

Of course, that isn't enough, we have to write good code too. Thinking about
the problem statement (that we've spent most of this post on) conjures up
[GoF] patterns such as the [Command Pattern], the [Strategy Pattern], plus the
[Producer-consumer] problem.

All which seem to have well tested, elegant solutions.

> But isn't [functional programming] the old/new hotness?

We'll get into that next time!

I do need to sleep sometime.

[^1]: A [Wick rotation] converts the factor of $i$ in the continuous path
integral to a minus sign in the discrete path integral. In the Einstein-Hilbert
action we keep $\Lambda$, the Cosmological constant, but ignore
$\mathcal{L}_{M}$,
the matter [Lagrangian] density. In the Regge action, we are essentially
summing areas times angles for the first term plus volumes times the
Cosmological constant in the second term.

[^2]: Or at least, enough times for the ensembles to "thermalize" into
representative distributions on which we can accurately sample the [posterior].

[^3]: $N_{1}^{TL}$ is the number of timelike links connecting vertices on
different time slices. $N_3^{(3,1)}$ is the number of (3,1) and (1,3) simplices.
$N_{3}^{(2,2)}$ is the number of (2,2) simplices. $k=\frac{1}{8\pi G_N}$, where
$G_N$ is Newton's constant. $\lambda=k*\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ is the
Cosmological constant. See? All numbers.

[^4]: I first attempted to do this from scratch in [Lisp], [Clojure], [F#],
and [Python]. I quickly came to the realization that implementing [Delaunay
Triangulations][5] and the necessary operations was several PhDs worth
of research in its own right (_which, in fact, [CGAL] is_). The choice of [CGAL]
influenced the choice of language; [Python] almost worked, but the
[SWIG Python bindings][9] weren't up to the task at the time. (_They still lack
access to the new dD Triangulation package, which I will need for (3+1)D
path integrals._)

[^5]: Good here means that the tools of differential geometry used on manifolds
in General Relativity have analogs in piecewise simplicial discrete
triangulations, i.e., triangulations are equivalent to manifolds.

[^6]: It would be almost hopelessly complex if we had to consider the entire
history of the universe to advance a single timestep!

[^7]: Alas, it isn't quite this simple because Metropolis-Hastings behaves
badly (_gets stuck_) if the acceptance ratio of moves is below ~25%.
Alternatives are needed if this is the case, which, for sufficiently large
triangulations, indeed occurs.
